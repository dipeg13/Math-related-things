# Lagrange Polynomial

This is a method that returns the Lagrange Polynomial in an interval [a,b], given a, b, N (the number of discrimination) and the points.

Lagrange polynomial is a polynomial that passes from a specific set of given points {(x_0,y_0), ..., (x_n_y_n)}.

# Euler's Method for Initial Value problems for ODEs

This is a method that finds (draws) the solution of an initial value problem in an interval [a,b], given a, b, N (the number of discrimination) and y_0 (the initial value).

That's an interesting method to solve problems like y'=f(t,y), y(t_0)=y_0, because you can convert almost every first order initial value problem to that form. (You can easily convert that method to solve initial value probles for systems of odes and then convert any order's initial value problem to a system of initial value problems that can be solved in that way.)
